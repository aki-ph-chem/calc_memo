# memo for molecular structure

## 1) In angel (noplanar molecule)

Use Rodorigues' rotational formula
in C++ use Eigen/Geometry (must include <Eigen/Geometry>)

## 2) In angle (planar molecule)

I think rotating the coordinates on an axis that is perpendicular to the palne
and passes through the center of mass.


## 3) In length between two atoms

I think expanding distance bitween center of mass and some atoms whic is target.
